## Overview

This project integrates traditional statistics with machine learning to identify biomarker candidates in proteomics data with small sample sizes (n=3). By applying PCA and LASSO to LC-MS/MS data from Sus scrofa kidney samples, we identified both validated high-confidence biomarkers and novel candidates missed by conventional univariate analysis.

**Key Finding**: 50% of top traditional statistical findings were validated by LASSO, while multivariate methods identified 20 additional proteins with substantial fold changes (up to 2.17×) that lacked statistical significance due to limited power.

## Dataset

- **Organism**: *Sus scrofa* (pig) kidney - translational model for human AKI
- **Samples**: n=3 AKI+Treatment vs n=3 AKI Control
- **Coverage**: 2,561 proteins quantified by LC-MS/MS

## Methods

### Traditional Statistics
- Shapiro-Wilk normality testing
- Mann-Whitney U / t-test for differential expression
- Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction (α = 0.05)
- Effect size filtering: |log₂FC| > 0.5

### Multivariate Approaches
- **PCA**: Unsupervised identification of variance-driving proteins
- **LASSO**: Supervised feature selection with L1 regularization and cross-validation

### Biological Annotation
- UniProt REST API queries for Sus scrofa protein characterization

## Results

### High-Confidence Biomarkers
**10 proteins** validated by both traditional statistics AND LASSO (50% convergence rate)

### Novel ML Candidates  
**20 proteins** identified by PCA/LASSO with large fold changes but p > 0.05 due to small sample size

### Methodological Insight
Zero overlap between PCA and LASSO selections demonstrates that different multivariate methods capture complementary biological information.

## Analysis Pipeline

1. **Environment Setup** - Import libraries and configure settings
2. **Data Loading & Preparation** - Load Sus scrofa proteomics data
3. **Data Preprocessing** - Quality filtering and normalization
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis** - Initial data examination
5. **Traditional Statistical Analysis** - Mann-Whitney U, FDR correction
6. **Multivariate Method: PCA** - Unsupervised variance analysis
7. **Machine Learning: LASSO** - Supervised feature selection
8. **Comparative Analysis** - Compare methods and find overlaps
9. **Biological Annotation of Novel ML Candidates** - Annotate 20 proteins with biological signal but p > 0.05
10. **Biological Annotation of Validated Biomarkers** - Annotate 10 high-confidence proteins validated by both methods
11. **Conclusions** - Key findings and learning outcomes

## Key Takeaway

**Integration is powerful.** With small sample sizes (n=3), traditional p-values have limited reliability. However, multivariate machine learning methods can extract meaningful biological patterns by analyzing relationships across features rather than testing each protein independently. The 50% validation rate demonstrates substantial methodological convergence, while the complementary discoveries show that different approaches answer different biological questions.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Classical proteomics statistics (normality testing, non-parametric tests, FDR correction)
- Machine learning for omics (PCA, LASSO, cross-validation)
- Programmatic biological annotation (UniProt API)
- Comparative methods analysis
- Reproducible research practices
